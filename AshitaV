#Hands-on Exercise 1
# 1. Install a package - data.table and give a name of function starting character "d"

install.packages("data.table")

# 2. Install and Load package -datasets. Use "women" data frame available in this package.
#    Find number of woman with height more than average but weight less than average

install.packages("datasets")
library("datasets")
women
mean.ht<-mean(women$height)
mean.wt<-mean(women$weight)

# Creating new dataframe with conditions applied
#subset returns subsets of dataframes with conditions

women_df<-subset(women,height > mean.ht & weight < mean.wt)
women_df

#The answer is 0. No observations meet the aforesaid condition
